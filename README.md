# 🩸 Blood Group Detection Using Hybrid Machine Learning Model (2025)

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **automatic blood group detection** using a **hybrid machine learning approach**.
The system takes **medical or biological input data** (such as image-based features or extracted attributes), performs **robust preprocessing**, **feature extraction**, and finally **classifies blood groups** accurately under varying conditions.

The goal is to build a solution that is **accurate, efficient, and explainable**, making it suitable for healthcare and academic use.
